## Mixing an album with OpenSource

The challenge was mixing an entire album from my band 'Neurotransmisor', using only open source, because I am very tired of out-of-print or trial software licenses. The chosen ones were Ardor, as DAW, and accessories for calves.
The process wasn't that difficult, but it took me several weeks mainly because I didn't have much experience with mixing.
The results were quite acceptable, the software stack is stable, intuitive and easy to use, I will definitely continue working with it.
