## Mixing an album with OpenSource

The challenge was mixing an entire album from my band 'Neurotransmisor', using only open source, because I am very tired of trial or cracked software licenses. The chosen ones were Ardour, as DAW, and Calf plugins.
The process wasn't that difficult, but it took me several weeks mainly because I didn't have much experience with mixing.
The results were quite acceptable, the software stack is stable, intuitive and easy to use, I will definitely continue working with it.
